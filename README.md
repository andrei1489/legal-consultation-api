API for Legal Consultation, a project designed to ease the process of public consultation with experts in Romania.

[See the project live](https://www.figma.com/proto/7VLlmWKJOjS3YXkOFjMRi0/Legal-Consultation?node-id=0%3A1&scaling=min-zoom)

Whenever a group or institution proposes a new law, there is a time when they need to consult with expert communities. For example, legislation on urban planning, construction, or architecture generally reaches the Architects' Order in Romania for consultation. The consultation period is very short and most of the time, not all members of these expert groups have the necessary time and tools to make their contribution effective. The consultation process within the group is very ad-hoc, made through physical documents, social media, or excel files forwarded back and forth between all participants, and these groups sometimes have more than 4-5 thousand experts who should get information and come back in a few days.

At the end of the consultation, things become even more complicated because a person needs to validate and consolidate all feedback in a coherent form that can be sent back to the ministry.

We build a digital tool for this type of consultation to allow these groups to work directly on the text, to contribute feedback, suggestions, comments, vote and amend certain proposals, articles or comments from other participants etc. and then automatically reinforce the final document. This tool will make it easier to consult with experts, giving enough time for everyone to express their opinion, eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy and allowing real-time access to the same information for thousands of people who otherwise would only interact with a single point of contact - centralizes everyone's opinions. At the same time, it eliminates all the useless time spent on formatting the law, consolidating similar comments, eliminating unnecessary or irrelevant comments, etc.

A big problem is also the legislative hat and the fact that when feedback is needed, they need to have access to a suite of other legislative documents in order to give a pertinent comment, which so far falls under the responsibility of each of them and has the capacity everyone to discern which adjacent document is relevant or not. Digital tools allow them to consult other relevant laws directly on the platform and make the necessary connections for all participants on their own.

The tool also contributes to the transparency of the consultation process, which will now be open to everyone, where everyone can see the comments of others and the end product.
